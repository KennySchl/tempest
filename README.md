# Tempest
Tempest is a [Discord](https://discord.com) API wrapper for Applications, written in [Golang](https://golang.org/). It aims to be fast, use minimal caching and be easier to use than other Discord API wrappers using http.

It was created as a better alternative to [discord-interactions-go](https://github.com/bsdlp/discord-interactions-go) which is "low level" and outdated.
