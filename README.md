# Library Rewrite in Progress (Do Not Use This Branch)
This repository is currently undergoing a significant rewrite of the existing library. The purpose of this rewrite is to improve the codebase, enhance functionality, and address any existing issues or limitations.

Important Note: This branch is NOT stable and should not be used in production environments.

The goals of the library rewrite include:
* Enhancing performance and efficiency.
* Improving code maintainability and readability.
* Incorporating best practices and design patterns.
* Extending functionality and adding new features.
* Resolving existing issues and bugs (mainly data races).

If you are currently using the library, we strongly advise against using this branch until the rewrite is complete and the new stable version is released. Using an unstable branch may result in unexpected behavior, breaking changes, or incomplete functionality.

To stay updated on the progress of the rewrite, please refer to the master branch or visit the project's official documentation. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work diligently to provide an improved and reliable library for your needs.

Once the rewrite is complete and thoroughly tested, we will release a stable version for general use. In the meantime, please continue using the latest stable release available on the master branch.

Thank you for your support and cooperation.
